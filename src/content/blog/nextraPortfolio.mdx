# The Decision to Build A Portfolio On A Documentation Framework
Documentation is the backbone of any successful software project, yet creating and maintaining high-quality docs often feels like an uphill battle. Nextra now allows the average user to build a powerful static site generator that transforms the documentation experience by combining the flexibility of Next.js with the simplicity of Markdown.
Why Choose Nextra for Documentation?
Traditional documentation tools often force you to choose between ease of use and customization power. Nextra eliminates this compromise by building on Next.js, giving you access to the entire React ecosystem while maintaining the simplicity of writing in Markdown. The result is a documentation platform that scales from simple project docs to complex enterprise documentation portals.

What sets Nextra apart is its zero-configuration philosophy. Out of the box, you get automatic navigation generation, built-in search functionality, responsive design dark mode support. Yet when you need to customize, the full power of React and Next.js is at your fingertips.
