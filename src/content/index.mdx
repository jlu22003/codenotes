## About Me
From a young age, Iâ€™ve always had a fascination with how technology works and dreamed of making an impact. For a long time, I struggled to find a meaningful way to apply what I was learning. My focus shifted as I observed the limitations and pitfalls of many languages and systems we used today. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve decided to deepen my understanding of low-level programming and the foundational concepts that are often overlooked in a traditional CS degree. Iâ€™m currently hoping to explore C at an intimate level to understand embedded systems and kernel development. From this foundation, I aim to build smarter, simpler, and more reliable tools for everyday users. My objective is to make technology more accessible while reducing friction in workflow.
